            Hi, I'm Stefan (20) and I'm an aspiring software developer.
          </p>

          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            In 2023, I kicked off my coding adventure, starting with the basics
            of HTML and CSS. Soon, I stumbled upon the wonders of SCSS and
            Tailwind, opening the door to frameworks like React. But here's the
            catch - diving into React meant diving deep into JavaScript. So, I
            rolled up my sleeves and made it a mission to grasp every nuance of
            this indispensable language. Each day brings new lines of code, a
            chance to learn, and a step closer to mastering JavaScript.

            Beyond the screen and keyboard, I'm all about the violin and
            Mandarin. Playing the violin isn't just about making music; it's
            about precision and attention to detailâ€”skills that spill over into
            the coding world. Then there's Mandarin, a language that's not just
            a new set of words but a brain workout. These outside-of-code
            pursuits aren't just hobbies; they're contributors to a skill set
            that's as diverse as it is resilient. So, when it comes to coding,
            or life in general, I'm all about embracing every opportunity to
            learn and grow.
